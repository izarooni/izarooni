I've dabbled in some languages teaching myself how to code for over half my life with software development

If you're curious, maybe check out my website where I talk about some projects: [izarooni.com](https://izarooni.com)  

I also have a Minecraft server, [play.izarooni.com](http://play.izarooni.com). There's no website for it but maybe I'll make one in the future! ðŸ™‚
